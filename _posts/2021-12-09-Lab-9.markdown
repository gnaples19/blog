**Lab 9 Reflection:**
1. **A quote from Dr. Goadrich: "Write a post about anything for lab 9 and I will give you all full credit"**
  - The easiest part of this lab was creating a github repo. That was it, everything else after that was absolutely disastrous. I think that maybe when I am at home for winter break I will do the tutorial on my own just to better understand the material. Cheers, happy break.
