**What skills and talents are most valuable in carrying out the social change work you are doing with your community partner? How well do those skills mesh with the talents or limitations you have come to see in yourself through the experience?**
- A huge skill that came into play when working with out client to accomplish a goal was communication. It is a little different then a more traditional skill because it goes both ways. A couple other talents that came in handy were being open-minded, especially in regards to direction of the project, and being able to break tasks down. We had a harder time getting work done when there wasn't any bite sized tasks. Through this experience I learned a lot about communication and ways to improve it.

**Consider the social, environmental, or spiritual need on which you are focusing for this Odyssey project. Do you feel that the approaches to creating social change employed by your community partner are effective ways of creating change in this area? Why or why not?**
- I feel our strongest impact was on an environmental need. Though this was not the strongest way to make an impact on the environment, but it was a nice step. To promote things like local farms and improving their efficiency helps them compete with larger chain stores. Ultimately, the use of local goods is undoubtedly more sustainable because the transport carbon footprint is smaller. By doing this project for free, we make this technology more easily available to them and prevent them from having to put more cost into keeping up with larger chain stores. One of the struggles of small businesses is their accessibility, by making them more efficient, they will have time for other things such as stock updates, website maintenance, expanding, etc. I feel that this is an effective way to make a change.

**Have you found any of your academic coursework helpful in understanding what you have observed and experienced?**
- My academic coursework was very helpful in understanding the experience of working on this project. Of course my database and websystems class was the most most helpful, understanding website design and elements was crucial.

**There are many social, political, environmental, or community issues on which you might work in the years ahead. How has this experience reshaped your views on the public issues that call you to action?**
- A significant conclusion I left with after doing this project is that there is no call to action that is too small. That no matter what community or environment I am in, there is room for me to make an impact, big or small. I look forward to using what I have learned over the course of this project, in both communication and coding, into my workplace as I continue app development for coworkers and clients.
