**Describe your setup experience in this blog:**
1. **What were the easiest parts of the tutorial?**
  - The easiest part of the tutorial was when I got to read about what was going on and not having to actually code anything.
2. **What were confusing parts of the tutorial?**
  - I had a really hard time understanding the parts that talked about putting break point in the SeedData.Initialize method, and the parts where I had to test things/ delete my database.
4. **What was difficult to translate when creating your own application in Step 2?**
  - It wasn't too bad translating except that I had a hard time separating my classes and variable names. For instance my class was called Motorcycle but somewhere I had a variable or an object or something that was called Motorcycles. So, the parts of the tutorial where we copied and pasted, I had to be careful about which name I used.
4. **What parallels and differences do you see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework?**
  - There being a horrendous amount of files and folders, I did not know where anything was at first. It made Jekyll seem easy to navigate. Also, it was also a static site generator. It was different in that we added our own database schema.
4. **How confident do you feel making another Razor application?**
  - I'm begging you to not make me do it again. I had to use every single braincell I had to even understand what was going on.
