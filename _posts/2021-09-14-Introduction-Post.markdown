**Describe your setup experience in this blog:**
1. **What parts were new to you? What parts did you struggle with**
  I had never heard of Ruby or gems until this class, so all of that was new to me. Installation was a struggle because I misunderstood the very first step which meant that I didn't even try the next steps until HOURS after I had unknowingly actually completed the first step.
2. **What parts still do not make sense?**
  I'm still not sure I entirely understand the concept of the gems and the exact process of creating the local server.
3. **What are you looking forward to?**
  I'm looking forward to making more posts on my blog and getting to do more to change the style and appearance of it.
4. **Your post must include at least two links and a list.**
  I'm considering this to be my list.

  Here's a couple of my favorite websites:
  [Ten Minute Mail][ten-minute-mail] because I HATE having to use my real email to sign up for stuff.
  [Pokémon GO Evolution Calculator][Evolution-Calculator] because I play a LOT of Pokémon GO and this helps me determine how powerful a Pokémon will be after I evolve it.

[ten-minute-mail]: https://10minutemail.com/
[Evolution-Calculator]: https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/en/tools/evolution-calculator
