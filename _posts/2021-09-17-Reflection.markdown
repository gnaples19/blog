You must include at least two links and two images in your post.  
**Make a new post about this assignment:**
1. **What parts were new to you?**
  - Trying to find the pathway through the terminal was a bit of a struggle, but made a lot of sense once I got there. Kind of a similar deal with step one and putting the author tag and linking the CSCI340 page in the nav bar took a bit of fiddling.
2. **What parts did you struggle with?**
  - I struggled with the first step the most honestly. It was a rough start.
3. **What parts still do not make sense?**
  - I'm still struggling with the  {% highlight ruby %} bundle exec jekyll serve {% endhighlight %} command. I can't seem to run it from my local server.

  Here's a screenshot of where I was struggling. Also I don't think I am able to figure out how to get the image to work but [here][Stack-Overflow] is where I got my idea from.
4. **What are you looking forward to?**
  - I'm looking forward to adding more posts of things I am passionate about, particularly my motorcycles pages.

5. Speaking of motorcycles, here's the new [bike][Harley-Davidson] I'm about to buy.

  Here's a couple of my favorite websites:
    [Ten Minute Mail][ten-minute-mail] because I HATE having to use my real email to sign up for stuff.
    [Pokémon GO Evolution Calculator][Evolution-Calculator] because I play a LOT of Pokémon GO and this helps me determine how powerful a Pokémon will be after I evolve it.
