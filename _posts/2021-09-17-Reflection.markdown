You must include at least two links and two images in your post. What parts did you struggle with? What parts still do not make sense? What are you looking forward to?
**Make a new post about this assignment:**
1. **What parts were new to you?**
  - Trying to find the pathway through the terminal was a bit of a struggle, but made a lot of sense once I got there. Kind of a similar deal with step one and putting the author tag and linking the CSCI340 page in the nav bar took a bit of fiddling.
2. **What parts did you struggle with?**
  - I'm still struggling with the  {% highlight ruby %} bundle exec jekyll serve {% endhighlight %} command. I can't seem to run it from my local server.

3. **What are you looking forward to?**
  - I'm looking forward to making more posts on my blog and getting to do more to change the style and appearance of it.
4. **Your post must include at least two links and a list.**
  - I'm considering this to be my list.

  Here's a couple of my favorite websites:
    [Ten Minute Mail][ten-minute-mail] because I HATE having to use my real email to sign up for stuff.
    [Pokémon GO Evolution Calculator][Evolution-Calculator] because I play a LOT of Pokémon GO and this helps me determine how powerful a Pokémon will be after I evolve it.
