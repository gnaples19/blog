So in theory this seemed like it would be a relatively easy chart to make. Everything in class made sense and all the examples were comprehensive. However, when I went to start this one I quickly realized how complicated it could be. I felt like I had way too many entities and it seemed like everything was an entity. Then I worried my relations were too vague or possibly that they should've been an entity instead. My biggest struggle was how to best design the different types of orders and the order substitution mechanic. My LucidChart Entity Diagram definitely isn't perfect, but I feel good about its ability to get the main points across.

Vertabelo is a very cool tool that was fun to use. I, however, was incapable of figuring out how to add primary keys and foreign keys even after looking it up. So my chart did not end up looking like it was supposed to, nor was I satisfied with it.
