Here are a couple of my favorite Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

First up is the [Fatbob][Fatbob], I personally own currently own a 2018 Fatbob with a Milwaukee-Eight 107 engine. It was the bike I rode to the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota in summer of 2018. The 2018 model Fatbob breaks away from the traditional dual-headlight that Fatbobs are known for and features one large lightbar instead.

Next is the 2021 [Pan America][Pan-America]. I remember being a senior in my high school AP calculus class when I first heard about this bike coming out and I lost my mind. It has been on my bucket list to backpack across Europe with the Pan America ever since. Three years later and it finally came out and it turns out the seat height is too high for me to even be able to stand it up. Dreams: crushed. Maybe one day they'll come out with one that's a better height for me.
